# Git Branching

Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. 

## Understanding branches

To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data.

In the local repo you are practicing in, let's create a directory called `test` and create 3 files within the directory: `test1`, `test2`, `test3`. 
Stage them all and commit.

```bash
$ mkdir test && cd test
$ touch test1 test2 test3
$ git add test1 test2 test3
$ git commit -m 'understanding branches'
```

What really git does when you commit your changes? 

First, git creates an object called **blob** for each file (blobs are actually created during staging). 
Then, git creates an object called **tree** for each directory (in our case, the repo root directory - `/`, and `test` directory) and stores a pointer to each blob belonging to the tree.
Git then creates a **commit object** that has the metadata and a pointer to the tree, so it can re-create that snapshot when needed.

Here is an illustration of our repo assuming only two commits were done.
The first initial commit with 2 committed files - `README` and `myfile.txt`, located in the root directory of the repo. 
And then the created a new commit, contains 3 more files - `test1`, `test2`, `test3`, located in the `test` directory:

You won't need it for your daily workflow with git, but you can inspect git objects by the `git rev-parse` and `git cat-file` commands:

```console
$ git rev-parse HEAD
984f4
$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree 783ed
parent 5tz20
author Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com> 1507361343 +0900
committer Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com> 1507361343 +0900

$ git cat-file -p 783ed

100644 blob 9eca129bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391	myfile.txt
040000 tree dabec60e688ae43df28beea0f49055e605cfc0ba	test
$ git cat-file -p dabec
100644 blob faf149e6799e9289eb2979033c5fe5d314706096	test1
100644 blob 4f3fb285b9db41007f3656718c06abc7b945aa16	test2
100644 blob e4bf129bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391	test3
```

If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.

So what the hell is branch?

A **branch** in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. 
The default branch name in Git is `master`. 
As you start making commits, you're given a `master` branch that points to the last commit you made.
Every time you commit, the `master` branch pointer moves forward automatically.

We will use a nice visualization tool, [`git-sim`](https://initialcommit.com/tools/git-sim) to visualize the git graph of your own repo. 

1. Since this tool is written in Python, we would like to create a virtual env in your repo, by:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   
   **Note**: `python -m venv venv` also can work, depending on the default python version in your system. 
2. Add the created `venv` folder to `.gitignore`, as well as another directory that used by `git-sim`:

```bash
echo "venv/" >> .gitignore
echo "git-sim_media/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "update .gitignore"
```

3. Activate the ven by: `source venv/bin/activate`. **Note**: you need to activate the venv whenever you start a new terminal session.
4. In the [`git-sim` official docs](https://initialcommit.com/tools/git-sim), follow the Quickstart section to install the tool.
5. To visualize your current git tree, type: `git-sim log`

## Creating a new branch and check them out

You can create a new branch using the `git branch` command:

```bash 
git branch testing
```

What happens when you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around.
How does Git know what branch you're currently on? It keeps a special pointer called `HEAD`. `HEAD` is a pointer to the local branch you're currently on.

To switch to an existing branch, you run the `git checkout` command. 

```bash
git checkout testing
```

**Tip**: you can create the branch and check it out as well at the same command:

```bash
git checkout -b testing
```

Let's do another commit and visualize the git graph by `git-sim log -n 50 --all`.

your testing branch has moved forward, but your master branch still points to the commit you were on when you ran git checkout to switch branches. Let's switch back to the master branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

That command did two things. It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the master branch, and it reverted the files in your working directory back to the snapshot that master points to.

Let's make a few changes (on branch `master`) and commit again. Visualize. 

## Merging branches

**You are highly encouraged to use the `git-sim log -n 50 --all` command to understand what's going on in your git graph.**

1. Checkout branch master: `git checkout master`.
2. Let's create a new branch which represents some feature we are going to work on: `git checkout -b myfeature1`.
3. Create some file and commit the changes.
4. Let's say you now want to work on another new bug. To do so, you need to switch back to `master`, and checkout a new branch called `bugfix` (we are always starting from an updated version of `master`, since this is the branch that reflects production).
5. Commit some changes in `bugfix`.
6. Visualize your git graph with `git-sim log -n 50 --all`.

Now we want to merge `bugfix` into `master`.
Merging branches basically combines the changes from one branch into another. 

**In order to merge one branch into another, you need to checkout the branch that you want to merge into:** 

7. Since we want to merge `bugfix` into `master`: `git checkout master`.
8. Then merge by: `git merge bugfix`. This command merges `bugfix` into `master`. 

Upon successful merging, you'll notice the phrase **fast-forward** in that merge.
When you try to merge between branches that their commits are connected in a "simple line", git simplifies things by moving the pointer of the branch that you merged into forward - this is called a "fast-forward."

9. Make sure that changes from branch `bugfix` have been merged into `master`.
10. Now let's switch back to our `myfeature1` branch and commit some new changes there.

It's worth noting here that the work you did in your `bugfix` branch is not contained in the files in your `myfeature1` branch, since that point you've branched out from `master` was not contained `bugfix`'s changes. 

11. You've decided that your `myfeature1` work is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. Merge `myfeature1` into `master`.
12. Visualize your git graph.

You'll notice that this merge looks a bit different than the `bugfix` merge you did earlier. 
Because the commit on the branch you're on (`master`) isn't a direct ancestor of the branch you're merging in (`myfeature1`), Git has to do some work. 
In this case, Git does a simple **three-way merge**, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.

Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it, called a **merge commit**.

13. Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the `myfeature1` branch, delete it by: `git branch -d myfeature1`.

Let's summarize your work:

### Two merging methods 

A **fast-forward** merge occurs when the target branch has not diverged since the source branch was created, resulting in a linear history with no additional merge commit.

A **3-way merge**, on the other hand, happens when the source and target branches have diverged, and Git automatically combines the changes from both branches, creating a new merge commit to reconcile the differences.

## Merge conflicts 

Occasionally, this process of merging doesn't go smoothly. 
If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you're merging, Git won't be able to merge them cleanly.

Let's simulate this scenario. 

1. Checkout branch `master`.
2. Create the following commits structure, as detailed below:   
   ![](../.img/git_merge_conflict.png)
   1. In branch `master` create a file called `file1` and commit it. 
   2. Check out a new branch called `dev`. In that branch create a file called `file2` with the below content and commit it:
      ```text
      Apple
      Banana
      Orange
      ```
   3. Checkout branch `master`, create a file called `file2` too, with the below content and commit it:
      ```text
      Apple
      Pear
      Orange
      ```
   4. This why the two commits are conflicted. 
   5. Create `file3` and commit it.
3. Now merge **`master` into `dev`**!

Git hasn't automatically created a new merge commit.
It has paused the process while ask you to resolve the conflict. 
If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run `git status`. 

**Git stages all unconflicted files, while moves conflicted files to the working tree:** 

![](../.img/git_merge_conflict2.png)

Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts.

Your `file2` contains a section that looks something like this:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD:file2
Banana
=======
Pear
>>>>>>> master:file2
```

In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself.

4. After you've chosen the correct version, run `git add`. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.
5. Commit the change.


## Rebasing

In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the `merge` and the `rebase`.
In this section you'll learn what rebasing is, how to do it, and in what cases you **won't want to use it**.

If you go back to an earlier example, you can see that you diverged your work and made commits on two different branches.

![](../.img/git_rebase1.png)

The easiest way to integrate the branches, as we’ve already covered, is the `merge` command.
It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (`C3` and `C4`) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (`C2`), creating a new snapshot (and commit).

![](../.img/git_rebase2.png)

However, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in `C4` and reapply it on top of `C3`.
In Git, this is called **rebasing**. With the `rebase` command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on a different branch.

![](../.img/git_rebase3.png)

At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.

![](../.img/git_rebase4.png)

1. From master branch, create a feature branch called `experiment`, commit 1 change in `experiment`, as well as 1 change in `master`, as describe in the first figure above.
2. Checkout branch `experiment` and rebase it into `master` by: `git rebase master`.
3. Checkout branch `master` and fast-forward merge `experiment` into `master`. 


There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for a **cleaner history**.
But, rebase can destroy other's work and mess your repo. Never rebase work of others!

# Exercises 

### :pencil2: Exercise - Checkout conflicts

A very common issue for Git beginners is switching branches while there are uncommitted changes in the working tree.
We will now simulate this scenario and discuss common practices.

Execute the following commands in your local repo:

```bash
git checkout -b co_test
echo "a" >> take.txt
echo "b" >> take.txt
echo "c" >> take.txt
git add take.txt && git commit -m "add take.txt in co_test"
git checkout master
```

Let's get started: 

1. In branch `master`, create a new file called `take.txt`, write some lines in it and add it to the index (don't commit yet).
3. Checkout to `co_test`, which error do you get? What are the two approaches suggested by git? Read about `git stash` command from the [Official Git Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash).
4. Open your project using Pycharm, try to checkout `co_test` again **using the Pycharm UI**. On the prompted dialog click **Force Checkout**.
5. Does `take.txt` contain your changes when you're now in `co_test`?
6. Checkout back to the branch you've come from, do you have your `take.txt` there? So what does **Force Checkout** do?

Before you checkout a branch, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you're checking out, Git won't let you switch branches.
It's best to have a clean working state when you switch branches.
