# Course Onboarding

## GitHub 

Create [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one yet.

## Linux setup 

First, you have to have access to Linux operating system (OS). Throughout the course we will use **Ubuntu**, which is a common [distribution of Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution). 
We recommend using either version **20.04** or **22.04**.
Please make sure you install it for the next class, so we can start smoothly.

Below you'll find various ways to install Ubuntu.


### Virtualized Ubuntu using VirtualBox

A common way to set up Ubuntu is to install it on a virtual machine (VM), on top of your existed Windows installation, using VirtualBox. 

VM requirements:

- At least 8GB of RAM
- At least 50GB disk space

Follow the below tutorial:

In addition, enable clipboard sharing between your Windows and the Ubuntu VM:

### Native Ubuntu

Another recommended way is to install Ubuntu Desktop as the primary OS on your laptop or PC. 
You can choose to install the Linux next to an existing Windows OS, or instead of it (in such case you may miss some Windows software, like Office, that are no longer supported in Linux).

## Python environment

Throughout the course, we'll be working with Python version >=3.8. 
Please install the below list on your Ubuntu.

- **Git**: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.
- **PyCharm Community**: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux (scroll down for community version).
- **Python Virtual Environment** (to be configured in PyCharm): https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html.
